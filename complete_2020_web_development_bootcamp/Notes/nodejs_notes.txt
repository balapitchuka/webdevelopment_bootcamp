- backend options available are:
		php
		ruby on rails
		java
		asp.net
		nodejs
		python
		
- Why nodejs?
	  1.we know javascript in frontend and now we can use the same to create backend
	  2.no need to learn new language
	  3.node is superfast, so helps us to build scalable applications
	  4.js in browser is limited in the sense but it only been able to interact
	    with browser, request information from the browser etc but cannot access things
	    like users file system, networking person etc
	  5. nodejs comes to helps in such case when we want to perform tasks like access file system etc
