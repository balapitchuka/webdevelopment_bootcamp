1. bootstrap is a frontend library or framework.
2. bootstrap is responsive(respond to viewports)  -- adapatable layout
3. bootstrap comes with prestyled elements that we can drop into our code with minimal ease.
4. go to codeply and type some code with and without using bootstrap : https://www.codeply.com/p/aEzbyqLhD7
5. download bootstarp 4.0 locally and examine templates and examples give, 
6. example online for references https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/
7. there are 3 ways of using bootstrap
   -- use cdn
   -- take starter template from bootstrap website
   -- download locally and use relative path pointing to bootstrap source in html
8. of above methods  use cdn approach because it will catch the page in browser, 3rd methods will not cache the image as it is from the same domain
9. https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/network/ use cdn to deliver from the nearest datacenter.
10. browser will cache the files and there is more probability that other sites also use bootstrap and can fetch the same from browser cache instead of from website
11. <link rel="stylesheet" src="src/bootstrap.css" this approach has a downside that browser always loads relative paths from browser instead of the cache.
